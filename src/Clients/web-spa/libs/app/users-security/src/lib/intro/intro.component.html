      Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account.
      In addition to your username and password, you’ll need to enter a code
      that Wlodzimierz sends to you via an app on your phone.

        When you sign in to Wlodzimierz you’ll enter your username and password,
        like always.

        When logging in from a new browser, you’ll need to enter an additional
        code from your phone or tablet.
      </li>
      <li class='mt-1'>
        Once you enter the code on the website, you’ll be logged into
        Wlodzimierz.

      We recommend using an application such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft
      Authenticator or LastPass Authenticator. These applications support secure
      backup of your authentication codes in the cloud and can be restored if
      you lose access to your device.
